            'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves

                Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
          
          All mimsy were the borogoves,
          
                And the mome raths outgrabe.

          "Beware the <em>Jabberwock</em>, my son!
          
                The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!</b>
          
          Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
          
               <b> The frumious Bandersnatch!"</b>

          He took his vorpal sword in hand;
          
                Long time the manxome foe he soughtâ€”
          
          So rested he by the Tumtum tree
          
                And stood awhile in thought.</pre>
